# ReverseData
First Draft
ReverseData Project
Business Problem
Sales Engineers and Quality Engineers are always in need of fresh and relevant data in order to do their functions. Without relevant data Sales Engineers are unable to demonstrate their Software Products to prospective clients. Similarly Quality Engineers aren’t able to test complete business process in the absence of relevant data. Currently there are many tools available that generate random data but none that generates data by reversing a process.

The tool Reverse Data will allow it’s users to define a criteria with data ranges and an expected chart curve. The criteria will then allow user to generate data which will yield the same curve when plotted on analytics tools.
Solution
The Reverse Data tool will be developed using MEAN Stack which allows user to define and maintain criteria for data generation and store generated data temporarily until the data is cleared. In first phase of the project a Sales Opportunity related criteria will be defined and data be generated. In second phase of the project the tool will integrate with CRM or ERP systems to push the generated data.
Technology
The front-end will be developed using Angluar/JS and Bootstrap to show criteria, allow edits and other controls. The backend will be developed using Node.js and MongoDB to store Criteria and generate Sales Opportunities data.
